# RoadRunner Hop 🐔🚗

## 🎮 About the Game

The objective of **RoadRunner Hop** is to cross an endless highway or series of roads and avoid obstacles for as long as possible without dying. The player controls a chosen character and must tap to move forward or swipe in the appropriate direction to navigate horizontally.

My personal high score is **66**—think you can beat it? 😏

I've added a little twist to my version—it's like Crossy Road, but **slower** and **reduced in speed** to make it even more challenging. Cross as many roads as you can, and most importantly, **have fun!** 🎉
